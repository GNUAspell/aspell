  // limit_edit_distance finds the shortest edit distance but will
  // stop and return a number at least as large as LARGE_NUM if it has
  // to do more edits than a set limit.
  // Note that this does NOT mean that the score returned is <= limit*w.max
  // as "sub" vs "submarine" will return 6*(cost of insertion) no matter what
  // the limit is.
  // The edit distance is 
  // (cost of swap)(# of swaps) + (cost of deletion)(# of deletions) 
  //   + (cost of insertion)(# of insertions) 
  //   + (cost of substitutions)(# of substitutions)

  // Preconditions:
  //   max(strlen(a), strlen(b))*max(of the edit weights) <= 2^15
  //     if violated than an incorrect result may be returned (which may be negative)
  //     due to overflow of a short integer
  //   (limit+1)*w.min < limit*w.max
  //   limit <= 5 (use edit_distance if limit > 5)
  // where w.min and w.max is the minimum and maximum cost of an edit
  // respectfully.

  // The running time is asymptotically bounded above by 
  // (3^l)*n where l is the limit and n is the maxium of strlen(a),strlen(b)
  // Based on my informal tests, however, the n does not really matter
  // and the running time is more like (3^l).

  // limit_edit_distance, based on my informal tests, turns out to be
  // faster than edit_dist for l < 5.  For l == 5 it is about the 
  // smaller for short strings (<= 5) and less than for longer strings

  // limit2_edit_distance(a,b,w) = limit_edit_distance(a,b,2,w)
  // but is roughly 2/3's faster
