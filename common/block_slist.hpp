// BlockSList provided a pool of nodes which can be used for singly
//   linked lists.  Nodes are allocated in large chunks instead of
//   one at a time which means that getting a new node is very fast.
//   Nodes returned are not initialized in any way.  A placement new
//   must be used to construct the the data member and the destructor
//   must explicitly be called.
